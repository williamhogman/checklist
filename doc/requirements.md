Requirement specification
==========================

Purpose
--------

The use of sheets of paper with a checklist of items have long been as
an aid to ensure that each step of a process is completed. Checklists
are widely used in many industries where it is crucial that the
business processes are performed with utmost consistency. However, the
creation and printing of these checklists is a tedious process,
requiring expertise in multiple fields, which unfeasible in many small
businesses.

To provide small organizations with the ability to ensure the
consistent application of business processes by the use of checklists.
The project aims to build a system for the creation of template
checklist and the filling out and archiving of the filled out
checklists.

Stakeholders

We have identified a number of important stakeholders.

### Management

consistently. Mangagement also wants accountability, answering the
question who signed-off on what.

### Process developers

The people defining the processes to be used in want to be able to
easily define the process in verifiable steps. The process may be
explicitly documented or simply tacit knowledge which is often the
case in small organizations.

### Employees on the floor

The employees on the floor want to perform process quickly and
accurately. They do not want to be slowed down by the filling out of
checklists unless they feel that this helps them perform their job
more quickly and with less mistakes.
